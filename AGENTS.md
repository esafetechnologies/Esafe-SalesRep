# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

`esafe_salesrep/` is the Frappe app. Keep server-side business logic in `esafe_salesrep/api/`, pure promotion rules in `esafe_salesrep/promotions/`, DocType definitions in `esafe_salesrep/esafe_salesrep/doctype/`, and the `/pos` page shell in `esafe_salesrep/www/`.

`frontend/` is the Vue 3/Vite POS client: views live in `frontend/src/views/`, reusable UI in `frontend/src/components/`, state in `frontend/src/stores/`, and global styles in `frontend/src/styles.css`. `esafe_salesrep/public/pos/` is generated frontend output; rebuild it instead of editing it directly. User-facing documentation is in `docs/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `cd frontend && npm ci` installs the locked frontend dependencies.
- `cd frontend && npm run dev` starts Vite on port 8080 and proxies API requests to a local bench on port 8000.
- `cd frontend && npm run build` rebuilds the committed production bundle in `esafe_salesrep/public/pos/`.
- `python -m unittest esafe_salesrep.promotions.test_engine` runs the standalone promotion-engine suite from the repository root.
- `python scripts/test_shift_schedule.py` validates scheduling edge cases.
- `cd frontend && node parity-check.mjs` verifies the browser promotion mirror matches Python rules. Run `node barcode-check.mjs` and `node clock-check.mjs` when changing those utilities.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use four spaces for Python and two spaces for Vue/JavaScript/CSS. Python modules and functions use `snake_case`; Vue components use `PascalCase` filenames (for example, `PaymentOverlay.vue`); composables and stores use clear `camelCase` exports. Keep API endpoints narrowly scoped and preserve the `esafe_salesrep.api.*` namespace. Support Python 3.7 syntax compatibility.

Keep promotion behavior synchronized: update `esafe_salesrep/promotions/engine.py`, `frontend/src/promotions.js`, and relevant parity scenarios together. Use existing CSS variables and component patterns instead of introducing one-off colors or controls.

## Testing Guidelines

Add focused `unittest` cases named `test_<behavior>` beside the affected Python feature. Cover boundary conditions—dates, currencies, quantities, permissions, and offline behavior—when they change. For visual Vue changes, build the bundle and attach desktop/mobile screenshots to the PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use concise imperative summaries, often version-prefixed (for example, `0.69.0: stock count from the till`) or scoped documentation prefixes such as `docs(website-guide): ...`. Keep commits focused.

PRs should state the user impact, list verification commands, link the issue when applicable, and include screenshots for UI changes. Commit regenerated `esafe_salesrep/public/pos/` assets with source changes under `frontend/src/`.
