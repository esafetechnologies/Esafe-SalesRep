"""A supervisor's approval for a refund (0.63.0).

The Zimbabwe shop (Phillip, 2026-10-20): "when processing a refund is it
possible to enable supervisor authorization for the process to continue,
password or pin?". Built the way cash out is approved (esafe_salesrep.cash_out).

Esafe-SalesRep Settings (General, Approvals and access, Refund approval):
- refund_approval: Off (the default, nothing changes) / Above an amount /
  Always.
- refund_approval_amount: Above an amount asks only past it, in the company
  currency (a sale in another currency valued at its own rate).

Only money handed back counts: the part of a return that pays for an
exchange's new items, or comes off what a customer owes on a sale on account,
leaves no drawer. A manager (Esafe-SalesRep or System Manager) needs nobody's
approval. The approval is a supervisor's passcode at the till (approver PINs or
the master passcode, as for discounts and cash out) or the SAME Return request
that clears a late or restricted return, approved for at least this amount.
Whoever approved is kept on the credit note and in the audit log."""
