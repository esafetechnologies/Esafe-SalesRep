"""Outlets and their registers (0.64.0).

A POS Profile is a REGISTER: one till, with its own shift and drawer. ERPNext 16
holds one open shift per POS Profile (POS Opening Entry.check_open_pos_exists),
so a shop where each cashier counts their own drawer has a register per
cashier. An OUTLET is the shop those registers stand in, the way Vend,
Lightspeed and Shopify POS group registers under an outlet.

The Zimbabwe shop (Phillip, 2026-10-23): three cashiers, each on their own POS
Profile, all selling from one warehouse, showed as three outlets. The owner
asked for the best practice for every shop, not for one, so:

- Registers that sell from the same WAREHOUSE are one outlet, with nothing to
  set up: the warehouse is where ERPNext keeps a shop's stock.
- POS Profile.esafe_salesrep_outlet names the outlet a register belongs to, for the
  rare shop that splits one warehouse between outlets (or spreads one outlet
  over warehouses). Registers carrying the same name are one outlet, whatever
  their warehouse.
- An outlet's name is that field, else the register's own name when it stands
  alone, else its warehouse without the company abbreviation.

Outlets never cross companies: a key carries its company."""
