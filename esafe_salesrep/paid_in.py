"""What each payment was handed over in (0.66.0).

ERPNext keeps a payment row in the sale's currency only. Money handed over in
another currency (ZWG typed on a dollar sale, the till's "Amount in", 0.61.2; US
dollars on a ZWG sale) used to leave nothing but its worth in the sale's money,
so the reports could only say "US$5.00" where the customer gave ZWG 135.

`record` keeps the currency and the amount on the payment row
(`esafe_salesrep_paid_currency`, `esafe_salesrep_paid_amount` on Sales Invoice Payment), and
only when that amount is worth what the row books at the shift's rates, so a
figure from the till that does not add up is never stored. A sale in another
currency already holds its own money on the row (`amount`): `of_row` reads that
for a sale made before 0.66.0, as the receipt does.

The close's merge (ERPNext's POS Invoice Merge Log) reuses the first sale's row
for each method and adds up only `amount` and `base_amount`, so the merged Sales
Invoice would carry that one sale's figure as if it were the whole shift's:
`clear_on_merged` empties the two fields there. The sales keep theirs.
