"""The reports without a till (0.65.0).

Management reads the shop's figures but sells nothing and works no register. In
ERPNext that is a ROLE: whoever holds **Esafe-SalesRep Reports** opens Esafe-SalesRep on the
Insights reports alone, for every outlet of the companies ERPNext's User
Permissions allow them, with no POS Profile to be assigned to. Holding Esafe-SalesRep
Cashier or Esafe-SalesRep Manager as well gives them the whole till, as before, and the
reports of every outlet of their companies.

What they may see stays the shop's call: the reports of Who can do what (sales,
cashier performance, profit, sales by salesperson) pass for this role while a shop
names nobody for them, and once a shop names someone, the rows decide (name the
role there to keep it). A switch in Settings (General, Insights) takes the whole
access away. Everything here is checked on the server, by every report.
