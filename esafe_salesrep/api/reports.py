"""Reports in Insights (0.62.0).

Asked by the Zimbabwe shop (2026-10-15, screenshots of another POS's
dashboard) and agreed with the owner in three phases. This module is the
first: a sales and cash summary over a period, and how each cashier did.

Everything is read from the till's own documents, the way the salesperson
report reads them (esafe_salesrep.api.salespeople): the POS Invoices, and the
Sales Invoices of an outlet that posts them directly, never a consolidated
one (it holds the same sales a second time). Amounts are in the company
currency (ERPNext's base_ fields), so a shop selling in several currencies
adds up in one. The cash counted at the close is read from the shift
(POS Register Session), each count in its own drawer's currency.

Phase 2 (products and profit): the lines sold, by item, group, brand, the item a
variant belongs to and its attributes; and what they cost. The cost follows
ERPNext's own Gross Profit report (erpnext/accounts/report/gross_profit): a
stock item's cost is what the stock ledger booked for it when the sale was
posted, here the Sales Invoice the shift's close merged the sale into (or the
outlet's own Sales Invoice); a bundle costs its components; a non-stock item
costs nothing. A sale not posted yet (its shift still open) has no ledger entry,
so its cost is estimated at the item's valuation rate in the outlet's
warehouse, as the report does when it has no entry, and is shown as estimated.
Esafe-SalesRep's own placeholder items (the gift card, the deposit) are not products
and stay out.

Who may see what: "See sales reports", "See cashier performance" and "See
profit" in Who can do what, nobody but a manager until a shop names someone,
and the whole of it can be switched off (Esafe-SalesRep Settings, Sales reports in
Insights).
