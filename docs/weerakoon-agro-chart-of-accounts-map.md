## POS setup notes

The tree view does not show account types, account currencies, disabled status, or the Mode of Payment mappings. Those must be checked on the account and payment method forms before use.

| POS purpose | Relevant visible area | What still needs checking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cash tender / register opening | Current Assets → Cash In Hand | Confirm this is a ledger account with Account Type **Cash**, currency LKR, and the Cash Mode of Payment for Weerakoon Agro maps to it. |
| Card or bank transfer tender | Current Assets → Bank Accounts | Expand this group and choose the real bank ledger. Confirm Account Type **Bank**, currency LKR, and map each corresponding Mode of Payment to the correct ledger. |
| Customer balances / due sales | Current Assets → Accounts Receivable | Confirm the customer control account is a ledger with Account Type **Receivable**. POS Credit Sale clearing is provisioned by Esafe-SalesRep when enabled. |
| Store Credit refunds / redemption | Current Liabilities (collapsed) and current assets | The customer balance belongs in a liability ledger. Esafe-SalesRep uses a separate Bank-type clearing ledger for the payment method and journals the movement to the liability. Do not map the Mode of Payment directly to the liability ledger. |
| Sales | Income → Direct Income → Sales | Confirm this is the intended sales income ledger used by the POS Profile / Item Group defaults. |
| Stock and cost of goods sold | Current Assets → Stock Assets; Expenses → Direct Expenses → Stock Expenses | Expand both groups and confirm the stock, COGS, and stock adjustment accounts required by the inventory setup. |
| Taxes | Current Assets → Tax Assets; Expenses → Indirect Expenses → Tax Expense | Expand and inspect tax ledgers and the POS Profile tax template. Actual tax accounts depend on the company’s tax setup. |

## Accounts not visible in the screenshots
